I need a web-application to crush my whole week. I need a web-application
only because I can access that application through a number of devices.
Crushing my week means setting goals for the week, prioritize them and
track them. All goals and habits that I want to form. That's what we 
call 'crushing my week'. An application that I can all weeks in a year,
click on individual week and setting stuffs for it.
